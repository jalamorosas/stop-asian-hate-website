        <p class="lead">
           Distraction - The key is to subtly intervene. The aim is to derail the incident by interrupting it.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
           Delegation - This is when you ask for assitance, a resource, or for help from a third party.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
           Documentation - It can be helpful to recor an incident as it happens to someone, but there are some things to remember to safely and responsibly document harassment
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
           Direct - You may want to directly respond to the harassment by naming what is happening in front of the harasser. This can be risky, due to the fact that they may redirect their abuse towards you, therefore escalating the situation.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
           Delay - Even if you can't act in the moment, you an make a difference for the person who has been harassed by checking in on them after the fact.
