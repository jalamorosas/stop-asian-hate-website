          President Joe Biden has recently made a plan to address rising racism
          against Asian-Americans, increasing accessibility to hate crime data,
          requiring new training for local police and establishing nearly $50
          million in grants to support survivors of domestic violence and sexual
          assault who face language barriers. This surge in combating racist
          violence is due to a recent attack in New York where a man was filmed
          stomping on a 65 year old Filipino woman. "We cannot be silent in the
          face of rising violence against Asian Americans. These attacks are
          wrong, un-American, and must stop," tweets Joe Biden. The Justice
          Department is going to publish a new hate crimes page that is focused
          on attacks against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. The F.B.I.
          will also soon hold civil rights training events to encourage
          reporting of hate crimes. Because of language barriers and questions
          about immigration status, victims have been afraid to report crimes in
          the past.
