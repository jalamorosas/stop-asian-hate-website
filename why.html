          The coronavirus pandemic has been a large contributor to hate and
          aggression against Asian americans. Anti-Asian hate crimes rose nearly
          150% in major U.S. cities in 2020, according to a new report released
          by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Asian american
          business owners have been forced to increase security and own weapons
          due to the increasing threats against their lives. Asian-owned
          restaurants, salons and shops rapidly lost business at the start of
          the pandemic because of racial stigma, fueled by former President
          Donald Trump's repeated references to the coronavirus as the "Chinese
          virus" or "Kung flu." Community leaders warn that the racism targeting
          these businesses could potentially worsen the country's economic
          recovery from the recession caused by coronavirus.
